Download the compiler
=====================

You can download the latest version of the Nim compiler here.

**Note:** The Nim compiler requires a C compiler to compile software. On
Windows we recommend that you use
`Mingw-w64 <http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/>`_. GCC is recommended on Linux
and Clang on Mac.


Binaries
--------

Unfortunately for now we only provide builds for Windows.
* 32 bit: `nim-0.11.2_x32.exe <download/nim-0.11.2_x32.exe>`_
* 64 bit: `nim-0.11.2_x64.exe <download/nim-0.11.2_x64.exe>`_


Installation based on generated C code
--------------------------------------

This installation method is the preferred way for Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix
like systems. Binary packages may be provided later.


Download one of these:

* `nim-0.11.2.zip (28 MB) <download/nim-0.11.2.zip>`_
* `nim-0.11.2.tar.xz (2.6MB) <download/nim-0.11.2.tar.xz>`_

Extract the file and follow these instructions:

* sh build.sh
* Add ``$your_install_dir/bin`` to your PATH.

There are other ways to install Nim (like using the ``install.sh`` script),
but these tend to cause more problems.


Installation from github
------------------------

Use the following commands to build the compiler from source.
Change the branch to suit your needs::

  git clone -b master git://github.com/nim-lang/Nim.git
  cd Nim
  git clone -b master --depth 1 git://github.com/nim-lang/csources
  cd csources && sh build.sh
  cd ..
  bin/nim c koch
  ./koch boot -d:release

The ``master`` branch always contains the latest stable version of the compiler.
If you want bleeding edge then switch to the ``devel`` branch and follow
the same instructions outlined above.
