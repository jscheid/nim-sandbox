# This file implements the Nim profiler. The profiler needs support by the
# code generator. The idea is to inject the instruction stream
# with 'nimProfile()' calls. These calls are injected at every loop end
# (except perhaps loops that have no side-effects). At every Nth call a
# stack trace is taken. A stack tace is a list of cstrings.
