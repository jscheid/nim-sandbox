main_dirty.nim
# A variant of the suggest-compile.txt, instead of using a "base" correct
# source, this one uses the "broken" main_dirty.nim which won't compile. The
# test tries to stress idetools to still provide a valid answer if possible,
# and at least provide the same output with repeated queries rather than dying
# after the first compilation error.

# The first query should work and provide valid suggestions.
