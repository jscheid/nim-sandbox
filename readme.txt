This package contains the Nim compiler, Nim's stdlib, tools and
documentation.

Nim is a compiled, garbage-collected systems programming language which has
an excellent productivity/performance ratio. Nim's design focuses on
efficiency, expressiveness, elegance (in the order of priority).

Read install.txt for instructions of how to build and install it.

The compiler and the standard library are licensed under the MIT license,
except for some modules where the documentation suggests otherwise. This means
that you can use any license for your own programs developed with Nim,
allowing you to create commercial applications.
